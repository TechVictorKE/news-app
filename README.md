# news-preview

In context, many people are busy workers and they get home really late. They always miss the news and they are very frustrated since they can't keep up
with current affairs. As a developer I decided to use my skills and prowess to remedy this problem. I therefore created an application that will help people
list and preview news articles from various sources in real time.   

## User Stories
As a user I would like to:
* Create an account with my details (username and password)
* Store my existing login credentials
* Generate a password for a new credential/account

## Running the Application
* To run the application, in your terminal:

        $ ./start.sh
      
        
## Testing the Application
* To run the tests for the class file and check if it functions well:

        $ cd tests
        $ python3 test_news.py
